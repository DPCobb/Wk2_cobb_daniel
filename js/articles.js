        "title": "Donate Your Old USB Drives to Fight North Korean Brainwashing",
        "author": "Andy Greenberg",
        "desc": "In the age of Dropbox and Google Drive, the USB stick has come to seem like a dusty tchotchke that belongs in the drawer with your iPhone 4 cables. But send your chunk of cheap flash memory into North Korea, and it becomes a powerful, even subversive object—one that a new activist project wants use to help chip away at the intellectual control of the hermit kingdom’s fascist government.",
        "text": "Late last week, the New York-based Human Rights Foundation and the Silicon Valley nonprofit Forum 280 launched Flash Drives for Freedom, an initiative to collect USB flash drive donations from Americans and then ship those slices of silicon to North Korean defector groups. The Korean activist organizations, starting with the Seoul-based non-profit North Korean Strategy Center, will then fill the drives with Western and South Korean films and TV shows and smuggle them across the border into North Korea, where their contraband contents can break Kim Jong-un’s ban on all foreign media. The glimpse of the outside world that those TV shows and films provide is meant to dispel the ideology and illusions the Kim regime depends on to control its populace: that the outside world is poor, dangerous, hostile, and inferior to North Korea.",

        "title": "Here Are the First Oculus Rift-Ready PCs You Can Buy",
        "author": "April Glaser",
        "desc": "Today Oculus Rift unveiled three new VR-ready PCs that excited, ready-to-be-completely-immersed gamers can pre-order in one week. The new PC towers, from Dell, Alienware, and ASUS, are designed to handle the powerful new VR graphics, which take a massive amount of rendering power to bring games to life in your headset.",
        "text": "To no one’s surprise, they don’t come cheap. Expect to pay between $1,000 and $2,500 for a Oculus Rift-ready PC—but if you were one of the enthusiasts that pre-ordered Rift, you may be eligible for a discount. And if you already own a super computer, there’s a chance that it might already be Rift-friendly already. You can test with Oculus’s compatibility tool, which you have to download so it can scan your system’s current capabilities.",

        "desc": "The scene takes place at Namib Dune with a view of Mount Sharp on the horizon. Curiosity’s Mast Camera took the images on the 1,197th sol (a Martian day) of its mission. A Martian day is about 40 minutes longer than an Earth day.",
        "text": "Open up the video in your phone’s YouTube app to view it best. By moving around your smartphone, you can get a high quality 360-degree look at Curiosity and its Martian surroundings.",

        "desc": "It’s no secret that open-source technology — once the province of radicals, hippies and granola eaters — has gone mainstream. According to industry estimates, more than 180 young companies that give away their software raised roughly $3.2 billion in financing from 2011 to 2014.",
        "text": "Even major enterprise-IT vendors are relying on open-source for critical business functions today. It’s a big turnaround from the days when former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer famously called the open-source Linux operating system “a cancer” (and obviously a threat to Windows).",
